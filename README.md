# Aviation_Analysis

Taking an airplane is one of the most important and efficient ways to travel. However, many travelers have experienced delayed flight. Which airline carriers delayed most often? Which airports have highest probability to make you wait for a long time? Also, which day of week and which month of year are better for your journey without severe delay?

The main purpose of the project is to explore the data sets by analyzing with different tools and technologies to give the solutions for different aviation problems. 

Due to the large size of the data set, the author retrieved the recent 11 yearsâ€™ (1998-2008) data for analysis.

All the analyses are made from four different aspects:

1.Find out the top 5 most visited destinations.

2.Which month has seen the most number of cancellations due to bad weather?

3.Top ten origins with the highest Average departure delay.

4.Which route (origin & destination) has seen the maximum diversion?
